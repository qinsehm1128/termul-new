//! Permission rendezvous (Story 1.7) — server-side ticket table for the
//! human-relayed `request_permission` cap.
//!
//! The ACP `Responder<RequestPermissionResponse>` lives on the per-agent
//! driver thread inside [`crate::acp::manager::AcpManager`] (it is `!Send` and
//! must not cross threads). This module holds ONLY `Send + Sync` relay-side
//! ticket metadata + the rendezvous policy (timeout, at-most-one,
//! first-response-wins, disconnect-deny, TOCTOU re-validation). It never
//! touches the `Responder` directly — it forwards resolution decisions back
//! through [`AcpManager::respond_permission`], which resolves the `Responder`
//! on the driver thread via the existing `AcpCommand` mpsc channel.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! [`crate::web::sink::WsRelaySink`] holds an `Option<Arc<PermissionRendezvous>>`
//! (server-side only — `None` on the desktop path, where the browser-less flow
//! uses the `acp_respond_permission` Tauri command directly). When the relay's
//! `emit` sees an `acp:permission_request` event, it snapshots a ticket here.
//! The `/ws` request handler calls [`PermissionRendezvous::try_respond`] for
//! `respond_permission` frames; the disconnect cleanup calls
//! [`PermissionRendezvous::deny_all_for_client`].
//!
//! # deny == Cancelled
//!
//! The ACP `RequestPermissionOutcome` enum has only `Selected` and `Cancelled`
//! — there is no dedicated "deny" variant. The architecture's "expiry = deny"
//! and "disconnect = deny/cancelled" are *semantics*: the operation does not
//! run. `option_id == None` → `RequestPermissionOutcome::Cancelled`, which the
//! agent treats as denial (the tool call does not execute). The browser learns
//! the turn's fate via the normal event stream (the agent continues; if it
//! then errors, that is Story 1.9's `AgentCrashed`, not a permission event).

    // --- Rendezvous bookkeeping tests (Story 1.7 AC3) -------------------------
    //
    // These exercise the relay-side ticket table + the rendezvous policy
    // (at-most-one, first-wins, stale/duplicate, TOCTOU, disconnect-deny,
    // timeout-deny) WITHOUT a real agent. The `AcpManager` is a no-op
    // (`AcpManager::new(vec![])` — `respond_permission` returns an "unknown
    // agent" `Err` which the rendezvous logs-and-continues). Assertions target
    // the ticket state (outstanding/queued/resolved/evicted) + the
    // `try_respond` outcome/error — the agent-side `Responder` resolution is
    // covered by the `#[ignore]` e2e test in `acp/tests.rs`.
    //
    // The rendezvous captures the tokio runtime handle at construction (so the
    // per-ticket timeout can be armed from the agent driver thread). The tests
    // therefore construct the rendezvous + call `register`/`try_respond` INSIDE
    // a single-threaded runtime (`block_on`) so the handle is captured and the
    // `Err`-fallback `tokio::spawn` path (if any) has a runtime to spawn onto.
