# Se Manager - Project Overview

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Type:** Desktop Application
**Architecture:** Tauri desktop application with React renderer and Rust native runtime

## Executive Summary

Se Manager is a project-aware desktop terminal workspace built on **Tauri 2**, with a **React 18 + TypeScript** frontend and a **Rust** backend runtime. The app organizes terminals by project, persists workspace state, supports snapshots and command history, and combines multiple interaction surfaces in a single desktop shell: terminal panes, file explorer, editor panels, and embedded browser tabs with annotation support.

The repository is a **single desktop application** rather than a multi-part monorepo. Its architecture separates concerns cleanly between:

- `src/renderer/` for UI, state, hooks, and runtime adapters
- `src/shared/` for shared TypeScript contracts
- `src-tauri/` for native windowing, PTY management, browser tab webviews, trackers, and migration infrastructure

## Project Classification

- **Repository Type:** Monolith
- **Project Type(s):** Desktop Application
- **Primary Language(s):** TypeScript, TSX, Rust
- **Architecture Pattern:** Layered desktop application with service adapters, state stores, and native command bridge

## Key Features

- Project-based workspace organization
- Multiple terminal sessions with persistence and restore
- Pane-based workspace layout with terminal, browser, and editor tabs
- Embedded browser tabs backed by child webviews
- Annotation tooling for browser capture/export workflows
- File explorer and live file watching
- Command history and snapshot management
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts and preferences
- Auto-update infrastructure with signed artifacts
- Cross-platform packaging for Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Architecture Highlights

- **Dual renderer bootstrap:** browser-safe `App.tsx` and Tauri-first `TauriApp.tsx`
- **Runtime adapter layer:** `src/renderer/lib/` isolates Tauri-specific APIs from UI components
- **Store-driven UI:** Zustand stores model projects, terminals, workspace panes, editor tabs, browser sessions, updater state, and settings
- **Native command boundary:** Tauri commands in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` expose PTY, browser tab, migration, and tracker capabilities through a consistent `IpcResult<T>` shape
- **Specialized native managers:** `PtyManager`, `BrowserTabManager`, `MigrationManager`, plus CWD/Git/exit-code trackers
- **Release discipline:** GitHub Actions validate lint/typecheck/tests/Rust checks and build signed updater artifacts

## Development Overview

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3+
- Rust toolchain (`rustup`, `cargo`, `rustc`)
- Platform-specific Tauri dependencies from the README

### Getting Started

Install dependencies with `bun install`, then run `bun run dev` to launch the Tauri app in development mode. The frontend is built with a Tauri-specific Vite config and served to the hidden startup window before the app shows itself.

### Key Commands

- **Install:** `bun install`
- **Dev:** `bun run dev`
- **Build:** `bun run build`
- **Test:** `bun run test`

## Repository Structure

The repository is centered around a single app root. The TypeScript renderer owns the interface and local interaction model, `src/shared` contains reusable contracts, and `src-tauri` holds native runtime capabilities, packaging metadata, and resources. Supporting docs live in `docs/`, while CI automation is defined in `.github/workflows/`.
