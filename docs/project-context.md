## Technology Stack & Versions

- **Desktop runtime:** Tauri 2 — `@tauri-apps/api` `2.11.0`, `@tauri-apps/cli` `^2`; Rust `tauri = "2.0"` (features `unstable`, `devtools`, `tray-icon`). Two binaries in one crate `se_manager_lib` (see Remote Parity).
- **Backend:** Rust, **MSRV 1.85**, edition `2021` (ACP 0.12 vendored → edition 2024 requires ≥1.85).
- **Frontend:** React `18.3.1` + React DOM `18.3.1`; two renderer entries — `TauriApp.tsx` (desktop) and `App.tsx` (web).
- **Language/tooling:** TypeScript `^7.0.2`, **strict** (`strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `isolatedModules`, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `jsx: react-jsx`, `noEmit`). ESM-first (`"type": "module"`).
- **Build/test:** Vite `^8.0.14` (rolldown), Vitest `^4.1.6` with `jsdom ^27.4.0`, `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`. Package manager **Bun** (`bun@1.3.1`).
- **Linting/formatting:** **Biome `2.4.16`** — NOT ESLint. `bun run lint|check|format|ci`. (Only `landing/` ships an eslint config; the main app does not.)
- **UI/state:** Tailwind CSS **v4** (`@tailwindcss/postcss ^4`, `@tailwindcss/typography`), Zustand `^5.0.9`, TanStack React Query `^5.83.0`, TanStack React Virtual `^3.14.9`, Radix UI + shadcn (`shadcn ^4.12.0` dev), `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`, `framer-motion ^12.25.0`.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM `^6.30.1` using **hash-router** patterns (both entries).
- **Terminal stack:** `@xterm/xterm ^6.1.0-beta.216` (+ addon-fit/search/webgl beta); Rust `portable-pty 0.9` with the in-tree `PtyManager`.
- **Forms/validation:** React Hook Form `^7.61.1`, `@hookform/resolvers ^3.10.0`, Zod `^3.25.76`.
- **ACP / AI:** `agent-client-protocol 0.12` (vendored 0.12.1 at `src-tauri/vendor/`), `tauri-plugin-mcp-bridge 0.9`, `ai ^7.0.4`, BlockNote `^0.46.2`, CodeMirror 6, streamdown `2.5.0`, mermaid `^11.14.0`.
- **Remote server stack (Rust):** Axum `0.8` (ws), `tower-http 0.6` (cors/fs/trace), `rust-embed 8.12` (embeds `dist-web/`), `reqwest 0.13` (rustls), `tokio 1` (full), `parking_lot 0.12`, `keyring 3.6` (OS-native per target), `ssh2 0.9`.
- **Logging:** `tauri-plugin-log 2` + `log 0.4` (desktop runtime) and `tracing 0.1` + `tracing-subscriber 0.3` (standalone server); `src-tauri/src/logging.rs` owns desktop setup, `server_main.rs` uses tracing. Renderer facade: `src/renderer/lib/log-api.ts`.
- **Shell tests:** `bats ^1.13.0` (`bun run test:shell`); hooks via `husky ^9.1.7`.

### Critical stack constraints for AI agents

- Treat this repo as a **Tauri-first desktop app with a built-in web/remote server** — not a generic browser SPA, and not Electron.
- `docs/electron-old/` and `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (the "pecutan" Electron design) are **archival** — do not treat them as active guidance.
- Keep native/runtime integration behind `src/renderer/lib/tauri-*.ts` facades. This is **machine-enforced** by Biome (see Code Quality).
- `src/shared/` is for shared contracts/types only; runtime-neutral. `src/renderer/` owns UI; `src-tauri/` owns OS/process/backend.
- **Two Vite configs**: `vite.config.tauri.ts` (desktop) and `vite.config.web.ts` (web client, aliases `@tauri-apps/*` → stubs, sets `import.meta.env.SE_WEB`). Don't assume one config.
- Use scoped `@xterm/*` packages, never legacy `xterm`.
- Keep renderer code test-friendly under `Vitest + jsdom`; keep native concerns behind adapter seams.

## Critical Implementation Rules

### Language-Specific Rules

- TypeScript is **strict-by-default** (`strict`, `noImplicitAny`). Prefer explicit types for public APIs, store state, params, and return values when inference isn't obvious.
- ESM-first (`"type": "module"`). Do not introduce CommonJS config/import patterns unless a file already requires it.
- **Aliases differ per config** — verify before relying on one:
  - root `tsconfig.json` (project-references aggregator) defines only `@/*` → `./src/renderer/*`.
  - `tsconfig.web.json` defines `@renderer/*`, `@/*`, `@shared/*` → `./src/renderer|shared/*`.
  - `tsconfig.test.json` + `vitest.config.ts` add `@material-icons/` and `@/types`.
  - `vite.config.web.ts` / `vite.config.tauri.ts` add `@/`, `@renderer/`, `@shared/`, `@material-icons/` (web also adds Tauri stub aliases).
  - Prefer `@renderer/*` and `@shared/*` in new code; avoid deep relative paths.
- Use async/await for async flows. Don't silence type/runtime issues with blanket `any`, unsafe casts, or catch-all suppressions. (Note: Biome's `noExplicitAny`/`noNonNullAssertion` are OFF, so these aren't lint-blocked — discipline is manual.)
- Keep browser-safe and native-aware code separated: generic renderer code depends on facades/contracts; Tauri/native access stays in `src/renderer/lib/tauri-*.ts` or clearly Tauri-scoped files.

### Framework-Specific Rules

- Treat the React app as a **desktop-oriented Tauri renderer that also runs as a web client**. Two entries: `TauriApp.tsx` (desktop: window state, crash recovery, remote projects, notifications, native menus) and `App.tsx` (web: `isTauriContext()` gating, Alt-menu prevention). Both share hash-router + the same pages/layouts/stores.
- Preserve the separation: UI/components/pages in `src/renderer/`, shared contracts in `src/shared/`, native/backend in `src-tauri/`.
- Reuse existing adapter/facade modules in `src/renderer/lib/` (`tauri-filesystem-api`, `git-api`, `shell-api`, `tauri-dialog-api`, `tauri-runtime`, `web-server-api`) before adding direct Tauri/plugin calls inside components.
- Reuse existing Zustand stores in `src/renderer/stores/` before new global-state mechanisms; use selector access to limit rerenders.
- TanStack React Query is an async/cache layer, not a replacement for Zustand app/session/UI state.
- Preserve **hash-router** navigation; do not switch to browser-history routing.
- Follow feature-folder component organization; prefer existing Radix/shadcn + Tailwind patterns over a second UI system.
- When adding behavior exposed to UI, gate native-only paths with `isTauriContext()` (from `@/lib/tauri-runtime`) and provide a web-mode fallback (see Remote Parity).

### Remote / Multi-Target Parity Rules  *(desktop ↔ se-server)*

This project ships a **shared-live dual-target architecture**. The desktop app and the standalone `se-server` share code — changes to one side MUST be checked against the other.

- **Two binaries, one crate** (`se_manager_lib`): desktop `src-tauri/src/main.rs` (`se-manager`, `default-run`) and standalone `src-tauri/src/server_main.rs` (`se-server`, feature `standalone-server`, path **outside** `src/bin/` so the Tauri bundler doesn't re-add it). The standalone is a **console** subsystem (no `windows_subsystem = "windows"`).
- **Shared `web` module** (`src-tauri/src/web/`: `router.rs`, `ws.rs`, `fs_api.rs`, `project_registry.rs`, `projects_api.rs`, `config.rs`, `permissions.rs`, `chat_history_cache.rs`, `assets.rs`, `sink.rs`) is consumed by BOTH:
  - Desktop in-process via `web::serve_router` (driven by `remote/host.rs` `RemoteServerState`) — **never kills agents**.
  - Standalone via `web::serve` (in `server_main.rs`) — **calls `AcpManager::kill_all` after Axum drains**.
  - ⚠️ **Kill-all hazard:** the desktop shared-live path MUST use `serve_router` (never `serve`). Stopping the shared-live server must NOT kill the desktop's live agents.
- **Shared `dist-web` bundle** is built by `vite.config.web.ts` (entry `App.tsx`, `SE_WEB` gate, `@tauri-apps/*` → stubs) and embedded into the binary via `rust-embed`. `tauri.conf.json` `beforeBuildCommand` builds `dist-web` **then** `dist-tauri`. Served by BOTH the desktop in-process server and the standalone server.
- **Shared `IpcResult<T>` contract** (`src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, `IpcResult.success/error`) is the body shape for **both Tauri commands and web routes** (`web/fs_api.rs` `IpcBody<T>`). Renderer facades return the same shape; transport failures map to `{ success: false, code: 'NETWORK_ERROR' }`. Changing any command/result/route shape MUST update all three: the Tauri command, the `web/*` route, and the renderer facade.
- **Shared `AcpManager` + `WsRelaySink` + `PermissionRendezvous`**: desktop resolves permissions via the `acp_respond_permission` Tauri command directly; standalone uses `/ws respond_permission` + the rendezvous (first-response-wins, disconnect-deny, TOCTOU-safe). Permission-flow changes must update both paths.
- **Renderer facade parity** (`src/renderer/lib/web-server-api.ts` + `tauri-runtime.ts`): when `!isTauriContext()`, facades swap to HTTP impls hitting `web/router.rs` routes. A new Tauri command exposed to UI must get an **equivalent web route + facade**, or be explicitly desktop-only-gated. Do not ship a Tauri command that breaks web parity without an ADR-acknowledged reason.
- **Remote exposure**: `src-tauri/src/remote/host.rs` (in-process shared-live, `RemoteBindMode::Localhost|All`) + `remote/cloudflared.rs` (tunnel). `remote_server_start/stop/status` are Tauri commands. LAN exposure is an explicit operator decision; auth/token-gating is not yet complete — don't assume it.
- **Mandatory parity check:** whenever you change desktop runtime/command/IPC/event/contract behavior, open the matching `src-tauri/src/web/` route, `server_main.rs` path, and renderer facade, and update all sides. Add a regression test for both desktop and web paths where feasible.

### UI / Responsive & Mobile Rules

"Mobile" here means the **responsive web client served by `se-server`** (phone browsers over LAN/tunnel) — there is **no native mobile target** (`gen/android` and `gen/ios` are not scaffolded; only `icons/android|ios` branding exists). Build UI to work in a browser/phone, not just the Tauri webview.

- New UI must be **responsive and mobile-friendly**: prefer `react-resizable-panels`, `react-virtuoso`/`@tanstack/react-virtual` for long lists, and existing responsive patterns (`components/chat/chat-responsive`, `chat-layout.ts`, `ProjectSwitcherDrawer`). Don't hardcode desktop-only dimensions.
- **Feature-detect native surfaces** (window controls, tray, native notifications, OS dialogs). Desktop entry `TauriApp.tsx` has them; web `App.tsx` does not. Gate with `isTauriContext()` and degrade gracefully.
- Keep the bundle **web-safe**: no direct `@tauri-apps/*` imports in components/hooks/stores (Biome-enforced). Route native calls through `src/renderer/lib/` facades that have web-mode fallbacks.
- Don't assume native chrome, drag-drop, or global hotkeys exist on the web/mobile surface — provide keyboard + touch equivalents.
- When designing a feature, ask: "Does this work on a phone browser served by se-server?" If not, gate it desktop-only with an explicit `isTauriContext()` branch and document why.

### Testing Rules

- Colocate tests with code: `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` next to the file (excluded from `tsconfig.web.json`). Vitest globs `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` + `scripts/**/*.test.ts`.
- Renderer tests run under `Vitest + jsdom`; do not assume a real Tauri runtime in unit/component tests. Typecheck tests via `tsconfig.test.json` (`bun run typecheck:test`).
- Test through public behavior and exported interfaces, not internals. Keep native/runtime code behind adapter seams so it mocks cleanly.
- For Tauri-facing behavior, test the renderer-side contract and the mocking boundary (facade), not native execution.
- For web/server behavior, test the `web/*` route + the `IpcResult` contract through `web-server-api.ts` (or a `tower` test harness for Axum — see `dev-dependencies` `tower 0.5`).
- Add regression tests for bug fixes, especially terminal/session/workspace, ACP/permission flow, and desktop↔server parity boundaries.
- Rust tests: `cd src-tauri && cargo test` (the `tauri = { features = ["test"] }` dev-dep enables app-handle test helpers). Shell tests: `bun run test:shell` (bats).

### Code Quality & Style Rules

- **Linting/formatting is Biome, not ESLint.** Run `bun run lint` (lint), `bun run check` (lint+format+import-sort), `bun run format` (write), `bun run ci` (strict CI mode, errors only). Don't add ESLint/Prettier configs to the main app.
- Biome formatter: **2-space indent, lineWidth 100, no semicolons (`asNeeded`), single quotes, no trailing commas.** `assist.organizeImports` is ON — imports are auto-sorted; don't hand-order.
- **Machine-enforced facade boundary:** `style.noRestrictedImports` = **ERROR** bans `@tauri-apps` + `@tauri-apps/**` everywhere **except** `src/renderer/lib/**` (override OFF) and `*.test|*.spec|vitest.setup.ts` (override OFF). Importing Tauri APIs outside `lib/` is a hard CI failure.
- a11y rules are **warn** (`useButtonType`, `noLabelWithoutControl`, `noStaticElementInteractions`, `useKeyWithClickEvents`, etc.) — fix them in non-test code.
- Match existing naming patterns in the surrounding folder. Reuse existing helpers/primitives before near-duplicates. Use Tailwind tokens/CSS variables over hardcoded values.
- Comments lean: add for intent or non-obvious constraints, not to narrate obvious code. Favor clear types and readable contracts over clever compactness for public/shared APIs and adapter seams.
- Keep changes compatible with the validation flow: `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test` must stay green.

### Development Workflow Rules

- **Validation before "done":** `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck` (`node`+`web`+`test`), `bun run test` (Vitest); Rust: `cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`. `bun run ci` is the strict CI gate.
- **PR gate (mandatory):** all CI checks green (PR Validation: lint/typecheck/test/Rust/Windows smoke; Build Verification; Security: CodeQL/secret-scan/dep-review/Scorecard) **AND** CodeRabbit review resolved before merge. See `CLAUDE.md`. Never force-push to retrigger CI without fixing the root cause.
- Integration branch is **`dev`** (per the indexed graph). PRs target `dev`.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. One problem per PR — no bundled unrelated changes, no style-only PRs without substance.
- Prefer incremental changes that fit existing structure over large unsolicited rewrites. If touching cross-boundary behavior, preserve consistency across `src/renderer/`, `src/shared/`, and `src-tauri/` (including `src-tauri/src/web/`).
- Update/add tests before treating work as done. Update `docs/` when a change alters user-facing behavior, setup, or architecture guidance.

### Codebase Discovery & Logging Rules

- **Use the codebase-memory MCP knowledge graph for code discovery**, not grep/glob for code. Discover the local project key dynamically with `list_projects` / `index_status` — it is derived from the repo path and differs per machine/contributor, so never hardcode it. Priority order:
  1. `search_graph` — find functions/classes/routes/variables (BM25 + name regex + semantic).
  2. `trace_path` — callers/callees, data flow, cross-service hops.
  3. `get_code_snippet` — read a symbol's source by `qualified_name`.
  4. `query_graph` — Cypher for multi-hop patterns; use complexity props (`cyclomatic`, `transitive_loop_depth`, `linear_scan_in_loop`) to find hot paths.
  5. `get_architecture` — packages, clusters, entry points, hotspots, boundaries.
  - Fall back to `grep`/`find` for string literals, error messages, config values, and non-code files (Dockerfiles, shell, configs).
  - Confirm the graph project/generation with `list_projects`/`index_status` at session start or after compaction; state coverage limits when making exhaustive/negative claims.
- **Logging is mandatory when adding a feature or flow** — it is the primary maintainability/debuggability surface (issue #244). The stack differs per target; use the right one:
  - **Desktop Rust runtime**: emit via the `log` facade (`log::info!`/`warn!`/`error!`/`debug!`). Routed by `tauri-plugin-log` (`src-tauri/src/logging.rs`) to `<app_log_dir>/se-manager.log` (rotated, KeepOne, 5MB) + stdout in debug. Levels via `RUST_LOG` (floor `info` release / `debug` debug; per-module overrides supported). A global panic hook and per-process `session_id()` (8-char) already exist — reuse `session_id()` for correlation-worthy lines.
  - **Standalone `se-server`**: uses `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` (`EnvFilter`, `RUST_LOG`) initialized in `server_main.rs`. Use `tracing::info!`/`warn!`/`error!` (NOT the `log` facade) on this path.
  - **Renderer**: import from `src/renderer/lib/log-api.ts` (`logFrontendError`, `installGlobalErrorForwarding`), which forwards to the backend log via the `log_frontend_error` Tauri command (desktop) or `POST /log/frontend-error` (web/remote mode) and never throws. Prefer it over raw `console.*` for errors/warnings that must survive a closed DevTools.
  - **What to log**: meaningful boundaries — operation start, success, and especially failure (with context: ids, paths, offending input/error). Errors must be logged, never swallowed silently. Levels: `info` normal ops, `warn` recoverable degradation, `error` failures, `debug`/`trace` dev-only detail. Never log secrets/credentials (keyring values, tokens, env contents).
  - Reuse existing helpers for new runtime entrypoints: `logging::log_startup_banner`, `logging::install_panic_hook`, `logging::session_id`, `logging::log_file_path`.
- **ADRs (recommended, not mandatory):** for significant architectural decisions, record an ADR in `docs/adr/` (ADR-001…005 exist) using the `Status / Date / Author / Context / Background / Architecture / Consequences` format, and register it in `docs/adr/README.md`. The `manage_adr` MCP tool can create/update them. Validate against the live codebase (see ADR-003's "Validation note" pattern).

### Critical Don't-Miss Rules

- Do **not** treat archived Electron migration material (`docs/electron-old/`, `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`) as active guidance.
- Do **not** bypass `src/renderer/lib/` adapter boundaries — Biome will fail the build on direct `@tauri-apps/**` imports outside `lib/` and tests.
- Do **not** put renderer-specific UI logic or Tauri runtime behavior into `src/shared/`; keep it contract-focused and runtime-neutral.
- Do **not** assume alias behavior is identical across `tsconfig.json` (root, only `@/*`), `tsconfig.web.json` (all three), and Vite/Vitest configs.
- Do **not** assume one Vite config — `vite.config.web.ts` and `vite.config.tauri.ts` differ; Tauri stub aliases are web-only.
- Do **not** treat the app as browser-history-first — preserve hash-router.
- Do **not** introduce a second state/UI framework when Zustand, Tailwind, Radix/shadcn already cover it.
- Do **not** "fix" strict typing with blanket `any`, unsafe casts, or suppressions.
- Do **not** ship a desktop-only Tauri command/behavior without checking the `se-server` + `web/*` route + renderer facade parity.
- Do **not** use `web::serve` on the desktop shared-live path — use `serve_router` (kill-all hazard).
- Do **not** build UI that only works in the Tauri webview — verify it degrades for web/mobile via `isTauriContext()` facades.
- Do **not** ship a feature or flow without structured logs at its boundaries (start/success/failure).
- Do **not** swallow errors silently — log them with context (ids, paths, offending input).
- Do **not** use raw `console.*` in the renderer for errors that must survive a closed DevTools — use `src/renderer/lib/log-api.ts`.
- Do **not** log secrets/credentials (keyring values, tokens, env contents).
- (ADRs are recommended, not mandatory, for significant architectural changes — `docs/adr/`.)
- Watch for regressions in terminal/session/workspace, ACP/permission, and desktop↔server parity whenever touching cross-boundary desktop functionality.
