2. Use the latest version to see if the bug still exists

When submitting a bug report, include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Node.js version, etc.)
- Screenshots if applicable
- Error messages or logs

2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/termul.git
   cd termul
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Workflow

1. Before making architectural or implementation changes, read `AGENTS.md` for the repository's current policies, boundaries, and known pitfalls.
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   bun run test
   ```
4. Run type checking:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   ```
5. Run linting:
   ```bash
   bun run lint
   ```
6. Test the app manually:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

#### Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:

```
feat: add workspace export functionality
fix: terminal not resizing correctly on window resize
docs: update installation instructions
```

#### Submitting Your PR

1. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a Pull Request on GitHub
3. Fill in the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue (if any)
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
   - Testing steps

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code patterns
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only when the logic isn't self-evident

```

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting
- Place test files next to the code they test (e.g., `component.tsx` and `component.test.tsx`)

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update type definitions as needed

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3+
- Git

### Running Locally

> **Prerequisite:** Before running `bun run dev`, install the Rust toolchain (`rustup`, `rustc`, and `cargo`) plus any platform-specific Tauri dependencies listed in the README [Prerequisites](README.md#prerequisites) section.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the Tauri app in development mode
bun run dev

# Run tests
bun run test

# Build for production
bun run build
```

### Platform Builds

> **Prerequisite:** Platform-specific Tauri builds require the Rust toolchain, the required compilation targets, and the OS dependencies documented in the README [Prerequisites](README.md#prerequisites) section.

```bash
bun run build:tauri:win        # Windows (x64)
bun run build:tauri:mac-arm    # macOS (Apple Silicon)
bun run build:tauri:mac-x64    # macOS (Intel)
bun run build:tauri:linux      # Linux (x64)
```

## Release Management (Maintainers Only)

### Creating a Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed:

1. Ensure version numbers match in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
2. Push a version tag: `git tag v0.3.7 && git push origin v0.3.7`
3. CI will build, sign, and publish a draft release
4. Verify the release assets include `.sig` files and `latest.json`
5. Publish the draft release

### Signing Key Management

Update signing is secured with a minisign keypair. The public key is embedded in the app under `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` / `plugins.updater.pubkey` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and the private key is stored in the GitHub secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`.

**Important**: If you need to rotate signing keys, follow the procedure documented in [docs/auto-update-release-verification.md](docs/auto-update-release-verification.md#key-rotation-procedure). The key rotation must ship the new public key in a release signed with the old key BEFORE rotating the private key in CI, otherwise existing users will fail to verify future updates.

Current key ID: `B7E0282B828EF719`

This project uses its own signing keypair, generated when it was split off from the
upstream project. It is unrelated to the upstream key (`6E47FAD95783D992`), so builds
produced here cannot be verified against upstream releases and vice versa — which is
the intended isolation for an independent project.
