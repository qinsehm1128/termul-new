/**
 * Web/remote project list wire contract (runtime-neutral).
 *
 * The desktop-hosted shared-live web server (`remote_server_start`) mirrors the
 * desktop's non-archived project list into an in-memory `ProjectRegistry` (a
 * deliberate bridge to Epic 4). The browser reads it via `GET /projects` and
 * receives live `projects_changed` WS events when the desktop mutates its store.
 *
 * # Secret boundary (frozen constraint)
 *
 * `ProjectSummary` carries NO env-var values (secret or plain) — redact-by-
 * omission. Secrets already live in secure storage; plain env is omitted from
 * the mirror for the interim. Only the identity/display fields a project
 * switcher needs cross the wire.
 *
 * Runtime-neutral: no `@tauri-apps/*` imports, no `@renderer/*` imports.
 * ESM-first. Strict-typed (no `any`). Mirrors the Rust structs in
 * `src-tauri/src/web/project_registry.rs` + `projects_api.rs` one-to-one.
